**Project Title:**

**AI-Based Waste Segregation System Using Image Classification**

---

**Project Description:**

**AI-Based Waste Segregation System** is a software solution that uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Image Processing** to automatically classify waste items based on their images. The system applies **Deep Learning algorithms**, particularly **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, to analyze the visual features of waste materials and categorize them into types such as **biodegradable**, **non-biodegradable**, **plastic**, **metal**, and **paper**.

This project aims to assist in automated waste sorting using image recognition technology, reducing human effort and promoting efficient waste management.

**Objectives:**

* To develop a **machine learning model** capable of identifying different categories of waste from images.
* To design a **user-friendly interface** where users can upload or capture images for classification.
* To achieve **high accuracy and reliability** in waste type prediction using deep learning.

---

**System Workflow:**

1. **Image Input:**
   The user uploads an image of a waste item through the web or desktop application.

2. **Image Preprocessing:**
   The image is resized, normalized, and converted to a suitable format for model input.

3. **Model Prediction:**
   The pre-trained **CNN model** analyzes the image and predicts its waste category (e.g., plastic, paper, organic).

4. **Output Display:**
   The predicted category is displayed on the screen, helping the user identify the correct waste type.

**Software Components:**

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries and Frameworks:**

  * **TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch** – for building and training the CNN model
  * **OpenCV** – for image preprocessing and analysis
  * **NumPy / Pandas** – for data handling and processing
  * **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for visualizing training results
  * **Flask / Streamlit** – for creating a simple web-based user interface

---

**Expected Output:**

* A trained AI model that can classify uploaded waste images accurately.
* A simple web application where users can upload images and instantly view the classification results.

---

**Future Enhancements:**

* Increase dataset size to improve accuracy and generalization.
* Implement multi-class classification for more waste types.
* Integrate with cloud-based AI platforms for scalability.
